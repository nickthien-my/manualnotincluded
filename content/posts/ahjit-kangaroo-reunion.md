> Our Dota player, Ahjit, gives a quick introduction to the new Dota offlaner, KanGaroo.

After the most recent change in roster for the *Dota* team, there was void that had to be filled with *Adam "adam" Shah* moving on. Answering the call was *Raphael "KanGaroo" Chua*, our new Divine ranked off-laner. He's no stranger to the world of Malaysian Dota and a previous teammate of *Ahjit*. So we got Ahjit to let us know their history, why KanGaroo was chosen and their future plans.

**How long have you two known each other? What&rsquo;s your history with each other?**\
**Ahjit:** *We've known each other for about 2 years now, we used to be rivals in the local tournaments. I was quite competitive with Kang as we both had the highest MMR in Malaysia at the time and he was usually ahead of me. So that motivated me to get better so that I could beat him.*

**Out of all your previous teammates and potential players out there, why did you choose Kang?**\
**A:** *To me, I think he's a very talented player and the timing was just right as he was also waiting to join a team which he didn't feel too "pressured" and can communicate well with. So I reached out to him and he came.*

**Now that the roster is complete, what are your goals and vision for the team? Any upcoming targets to hit?**\
**A:** *I think every team has the desire to be the best Dota team out there and we're aiming to be the best in the SEA region. As for our current goals, we hope that we're able to qualify for some of the minors and majors that take place in our region and go against the best of the best!*

**Thank you for your time and good luck in your upcoming games!**\
**A:** *Thank you!*
