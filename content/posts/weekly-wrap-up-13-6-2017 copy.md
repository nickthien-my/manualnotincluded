Last week in Fire Dragoon.

The *Fire Dragoon League of Legends* team kicked off the second week of their *The Legends Circuit 2017* season against *Kuala Lumpur Hunters*. Going against last year's champion is not an easy task as the team struggled to score a victory over them. But the team didn't have time to be depressed over their loss as they had another match against *Twice* the following afternoon. Not letting the defeat from the previous day get to them, they managed to score two victories over Twice. The two matches against KLH and Twice resulted in 3 points for FDG moving them up to 4th place.

The *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* team started their online qualifiers for the *DreamHack Masters Malm√∂ 2017* against *InFrNL*. Sadly, InFrNL faced a technical mishap that limited them to only having 4 players instead of the full roster. This gave them a disadvantage but they decided to keep on playing to the end even with the handicap. The win from this round resulted in moving our team into the top 64 teams in the India and South-East Asia region.
