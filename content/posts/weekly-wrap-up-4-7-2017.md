### Counter Strike: Global Offensive

The *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* team managed to qualify and secure a spot in the *Orange Esports&#39; B5 Battle Arena Main Event*. Along with 7 other teams from all over Asia, they will be taking part in the Main Event on the 8th of July at the *Orange Stadium, Setapak*.

Seeing their first LAN action after months of online competitions, the team participated in the B5 Battle Arena LAN Qualifier after not being able to make the grade in the *Online Qualifiers*. While it was disappointing that we only managed to see the team play in only one game against *MetamorphiC Gaming*, the team still showed their prowess by defeating them  16 to 8.

### League of Legends

For their last match in *The Legends Circuit MY Summer 2017 Group Stage*, *Fire Dragoon&#39;s League of Legends* team went against *Orange Esports **Swestic* but was defeated in both of their games. After the shakeup of the week's matches, the team was pushed out of the playoff spot and landed on 5th place. Ending their debut season in the group stages.

During the group stage, the team managed to score a total of 8 points out of the possible 21 points. Winning 2 matches and drawing 2 out of the 7 matches. With the group stages coming to an end, it also marks the end for most of the team's participation in events for the rest of the year. We wish our team all the best and hope to see them come back stronger next year.

### Dota 2

Taking part in the *WCA 2017 APAC Region Open Qualification*, the Fire Dragoon's *Dota 2* team was knocked out in the round of 16 by *KchatNo1* in the *1st Qualification* and later in the week they were knocked out of the quarterfinals of the *2nd Qualification* by the Filipino team, *YMFI*.
